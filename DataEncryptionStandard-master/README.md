DataEncryptionStandard
======================

_Co-authored by Hoi Kit Goodwin Lam._<br />
A complete JavaSE 7 implementation of the Data Encryption Standard as documented in FIPS 46-3.<br />
(see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf)

###DES Class
Main DES class, handling the overall logic of the standard. Allows standard DES encryption and
decryption options while also supporting cipher-block chaining mode encryption and decryption.<br />
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29<br />
and http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip81.htm)

###FeistelFunction Class
Handles the main logic involving the F-Function, including expansion, key mixing, substitutions
and permutation. Not intended for use by outside classes.

###RoundKeyGenerator Class
Handles all logic relating to generating all the round-keys out of the 56 bit input key. Not intended
for use by outside classes.

###DESInterface
_Not required for use with this DES implementation._<br />
Basic UI for testing functionality with an input file.
